My very first project as a beginner which I completed in 2023 for my ICT course, a Software Learning Website designed to provide resources and guidance for multiple programming languages on a single platform. The website includes a structured homepage with a video background, navigation bar, services section highlighting different languages, external learning resource links, a user login form, and a contact section.

Through this project, I developed and strengthened my skills in HTML, CSS, UI/UX design, web layout structuring, form design, and multimedia integration. It was a valuable hands-on experience that helped me build a strong foundation in front-end web development.
